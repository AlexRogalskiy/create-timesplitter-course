# Create Timesplitter Course

Create amazing courses and stay on time.

## Get started building a Timesplitter Course

The fastest way to get started building courses is to run the following commands:

```
npx @moonhighway/create-timesplitter-course My First Course
cd my-first-course
npm run develop
```

This creates a default starter course and installs [@moonhighway/timesplitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonhighway/timesplitter) and [@moonhighway/timesplitter-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonhighway/timesplitter-dev), which are packages for creating and running timesplitter courses.

Once you run `npm run develop`, Timesplitter's course developer will be running at [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242). Simply go to the browser in this url to display your course notes. _note:if 4200 is unavailable then a random port will be chosen_.

## Run Your New Course

Once you have built your course you can run the [@moonhighway/timesplitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonhighway/timesplitter), which is the ultamate presenters assistant. The timesplitter will take you through your course notes and keep you on time.

All you have to do to run the timesplitter once you have created a course is run:

```
npm start
```

This starts the timesplitter running at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Simply go to the browser in this url to display your course notes. _note:if 4200 is unavailable then a random port will be chosen_.
